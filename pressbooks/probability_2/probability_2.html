<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify;text-indent: 2em">The study of probability, though having very ancient roots, began its modern development in the seventeenth century through the correspondence between Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. Their analysis of games of chance, particularly the “division of stakes” problem, laid the foundations of modern probability. Jacob Bernoulli’s <em>Ars Conjectandi</em> later provided the first classical definition, and refinements by De Moivre and Laplace deepened the analytical structure. The full axiomatization came in 1933 with Kolmogorov’s <em>Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung</em>.</p>
