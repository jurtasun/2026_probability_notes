<h3 style="text-align: justify">1.1. Sampling and data types</h3>
<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">All statistical inquiries begin with observations and measurements, which we normally refer to as <em>data</em>. And data begins with the act of selection, or <em>sampling</em>. The natural world overflows with phenomena, offering endless opportunities for observation, but only a finite subset can ever be recorded. This distinction gives rise to two central notions: the <em>population</em>, which we will write as \(\mathcal{P}\), and the <em>sample</em>, denoted by \(\mathcal{S}\). By <em>population</em> we mean the complete set of all possible observations under study, normally written as
\[
\mathcal{P} = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N\} \; .
\]</p>
<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">The <em>sample</em>, on the other hand, is the finite subset actually collected. For a series of \(N\) observations \(x_1\), \(x_2\), ..., \(x_N\), a sample of just \(n\) elements—less than the total, which is normally denoted by the upper case \(N\)—is defined as
\[
\mathcal{S} = \{\chi_1, \chi_2, \dots, \chi_n\}, \quad n &lt; N \; ,
\]</p>
<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">where the \(\chi_i\)-labels remind us that the sample consists of selected observations from the population, not necessarily consecutive or all of them. The population represents the ideal object of inference, while the sample is the concrete, finite evidence available to us. This distinction is far from trivial; a poorly chosen sample often misrepresents the population and may induce bias, whereas a carefully constructed one mirrors its essential features, and can be used to describe the underlying nature.</p>
<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">Equally important is the recognition that not all data are of the same kind. A common distinction is to consider <em>categorical</em> and <em>numerical</em> data. Categorical—or <em>qualitative—</em>data describes qualities or labels such as the eye colour of students in a classroom (blue, brown, green), the brand of a smartphone, etc. Sometimes they are further divided into <em>nominal</em> categories, with no natural order, like the eye colour or the smartphone brand, and <em>ordinal</em> categories with a meaningful order. Examples of these would be the finishing places in a race (first, second, third), survey responses ranging from <em>strongly disagree</em> to <em>strongly agree</em>, etc.</p>
<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">The other big group is normally referred to as numerical—or <em>quantitative—</em>data. These measure numerical quantities and are often subdivided into <em>discrete</em>, countable numbers, such as the number of books on a shelf (4, 5, 6) or the number of goals scored in a match, and <em>continuous</em> values that can take any number within a range, such as the time a sprinter takes to run 100 meters, or the height of a person measured with some arbitrary precision.</p>
<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">Distinguishing between these types is no mere slang; different types of observations require different mathematical tools, and will be described in different ways. For example, it would not make sense to compute a mean out of smartphone brands, but to compute the mean of their prices is informative. Similarly, the distribution of finishing places after a race might be summarized by a median position, whereas heights of athletes could be studied with averages and measures of spread. A correct classification of data is thus a safeguard against misuse and a guide toward insight.</p>
<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">As a summary, sampling and proper description of data establish the ground upon which statistics is built. Before calculating, summarizing, or diving into inference, one must ensure that the information collected is both representative and properly understood. Without these foundations, descriptive measures risk floating unmoored, detached from the reality they claim to represent. Accurate sampling and rigorous description will lead to a faithful representation of the phenomena under study and their relationships, detecting anomalies, and even building accurate predictions.</p>
<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">In the recent decades, experimental scientists have become aware of a certain tendency to use statistics as a crutch, relying on them for validation rather than seeking genuine understanding. Scottish poet Andrew Lang marvellously summarizes this tren in his famous quote <em>"most people use statistics as a drunken man uses lamp-posts—for support rather than illumination". </em>Lang's observation serves as a cautionary reminder to approach statistical data with critical thinking and not merely as a tool to bolster preconceived notions.</p>
