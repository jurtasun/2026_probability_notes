<h3>1.3 Data visualization</h3>
<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">While numerical summaries are useful, the human mind often understands patterns much faster through vision than calculation. By <em>data visualization</em> we mean a series of techniques used to transform numbers and sequences into shapes, colours and structures that are easier to interpret, and that can be grasped at a glance. It turns abstraction into perception and often reveals regularities invisible to formulas alone. Nowadays, a broad series of fields falling under the name of data visualization—or data representation—have become among the pillars of any scientific or data related topic.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">The <em>histogram</em> is found among the oldest and most fundamental visualization tools. The concept of dividing data into intervals to visualize frequency dates back to Karl Pearson in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, who formalized it as a graphical representation of probability distributions \cite{pearson1892}. A histogram divides the range of a dataset into consecutive intervals, or <em>bins</em>, and represents the amount—or relative <em>frequency</em>—of observations falling within each bin as the height of a bar. This simple yet powerful plot provides an immediate visual impression of the dataset’s distribution, allowing one to identify symmetry, skewness, concentration of values, and potential gaps. For example, a symmetric histogram, like the one in LHS of Figure \ref{fig:histogram_comparison1} suggests a roughly balanced distribution around the mean, while a right-skewed histogram, like the one displayed in the RHS of Figure \ref{fig:histogram_comparison1}, indicates that higher values are less frequent—or less <em>probable</em>—but can yet influence measures like the mean. This is the state of the art in physical sciences and whenever observations are supposed to fit a mathematical prediction.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">Building a histogram in an informative way is extremely powerful, and there are some subtleties to consider. As a rule of thumb, look for natural divisions in the data, and keep all bins the same size, covering the whole range under study. Outliers can skew, so they must be treated carefully. Figures \ref{fig:histogram_comparison2} and \ref{fig:histogram_comparison3} show how the binning size can affect the distribution of data. Smaller binning leads to more resolution but can be easily distorted in the presence of outliers, while few large bins are robust agains though losing the accuracy in resolution. For skewed distributions it is normally better to use the median and the IQR.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">The box plot, also known as the <em>box-and-whisker</em> plot, was introduced by John Tukey in 1970 as part of his work on exploratory data analysis \cite{tukey1977}. The box plot offers a compact summary of a dataset’s central tendency, spread, and potential outliers. Constructed from five key statistics—the minimum, first quartile (\(Q_1\)), median (\(Q_2\)), third quartile (\(Q_3\)), and maximum—it clearly shows the <em>interquartile range</em> (IQR = \(Q_3 - Q_1\)) and highlights points that fall outside 1.5 times the IQR as outliers. This representation allows for quick comparisons across multiple groups, and it is particularly useful for detecting asymmetry and variability without being overly influenced by extreme values. It is widely used in biological and clinical sciences where an experiment can be repeated many times with relatively small sample sizes. Figure \ref{fig:box_comparison} displays the same data represented as histograms in Figures \ref{fig:histogram_comparison1} as box plots.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">Finally, the <em>violin</em> plot is a more recent innovation, combining the box plot with a series of mathematical tools that represent as well the shape of the distribution. While the precise origin is less formally documented, it gained prominence in the late 20th century in statistical software environments, such as R, during the 1990s \cite{hintze1997}. Essentially, the violin plot extends the concept of the box plot by combining it with a kernel density estimate of the data. This plot not only displays the median and quartiles but also provides a smooth depiction of the distribution’s shape, revealing features such as multimodality or skewness that might be obscured in a simple box plot. By showing both summary statistics and the underlying density, the violin plot gives a richer, more nuanced view of the dataset, particularly when comparing several groups side by side. As an example of such comparison, see Figure [...].</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em">To conclude, let us emphasize that graphs and diagrams are not mere decoration but deeply useful instruments of analysis. They allow patterns to leap from obscurity in shallow data, invite hypotheses, and sometimes contradict assumptions and expectation. In practice, visualization is both a beginning and a test: a first impression of data, and a final check on the reasonableness of results derived through calculation.</p>
